        "- When data conflicts exist, acknowledge discrepancies and explain resolution\n"
        "- If confidence scores are low (<0.6), clearly indicate uncertainty levels\n"
        "- For incomplete data, specify analysis limitations and affected insights\n"
        "- Provide alternative interpretations when evidence is ambiguous\n"
        "\n"
        "### Cross-Validation Logic\n"
        "- Trends appearing in both sources: Base confidence + 0.2\n"
        "- Video frequency >10 appearances: Additional +0.1 confidence\n"
        "- Web evidence_strength >0.8: Additional +0.1 confidence\n"
