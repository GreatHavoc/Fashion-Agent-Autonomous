Key trends indicate a strong movement towards oversized and structured silhouettes, with A-line cuts and high-waisted bottoms gaining significant traction. While the runway shows a dominance of classic neutral colors like black and white, editorial content strongly advocates for a vibrant winter palette, including regal red and espresso brown. In materials, there is a dual trend of traditional fabrics like wool and tweed coexisting with a rising interest in handcrafted and sustainable textiles such as Manipuri weaves. Style is heavily influenced by international celebrities and K-pop culture, popularizing aesthetics that blend preppy, punk, and streetwear elements. Simultaneously, there is a significant trend towards modernizing traditional garments like Kashmiri Pherans and Kaftans for contemporary wear. Textural patterns like embroidery and woven details are more prominent than traditional prints. Overall, the market is moving towards expressive, individualistic styles that prioritize both comfort and a strong fashion statement."
