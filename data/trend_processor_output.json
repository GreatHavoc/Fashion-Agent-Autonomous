The runway shows a strong preference for structured, tailored silhouettes and a neutral color palette dominated by black, white, and grey. In contrast, online content and celebrity style point towards a rising trend of vibrant winter colors like Regal Red and Edgy Eggplant, alongside comfortable, oversized silhouettes and the modernization of traditional textiles. Key cross-validated trends include the prominence of wool and denim fabrics, the rising popularity of A-line/fit-and-flare cuts, and a growing interest in detailed embroidery. Commercially, classic tailored pieces and versatile accessories show the most immediate potential, while the vibrant color trend indicates a key direction for future seasons."
