  "self_analysis": "Initial scrape from Times of India Fashion section is complete. I have filtered the articles to focus on Gen Z and casual wear trends in India. The initial analysis points towards a few key themes: the growing influence of K-pop and international celebrity style on Indian youth (e.g., Jisoo's sister, Dua Lipa), a continued interest in modernized traditional Indian wear (e.g., Sonam Kapoor's Manipuri weaves), the rise of homegrown Indian fashion brands, and the emergence of gender-fluid fashion expressions. I have excluded articles that were heavily focused on bridal wear, high-end luxury that is not accessible to a younger demographic, and general news stories that were not trend-focused. The next steps will be to process more sources to see if these initial hypotheses are confirmed and to identify more specific trends in silhouettes, fabrics, and accessories.",
