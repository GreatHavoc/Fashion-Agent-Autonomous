The Voice of Fashion and Times of India Fashion provided much more relevant content. I've identified several articles discussing handlooms, traditional textiles (Odisha Ikat, Eri silk, Ajrakh), traditional Indian wear (sarees, lehengas, dhoti) with modern interpretations, and sustainable fashion practices. The focus on festive wear during Durga Puja and Navratri from Times of India also highlights the ongoing relevance and potential for fusion in traditional attire. I will continue to look for more specific examples of Gen Z casual wear and explicit mentions of sustainable practices within Indian fashion."
