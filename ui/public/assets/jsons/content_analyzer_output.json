The dhoti, for instance, has evolved into comfortable and stylish dhoti pants and skirts, suitable for casual and festive wear, and even gaining gender-neutral appeal. Anamika Khanna's AK|OK collection exemplifies this by blending Indian heritage (chikankari, mythological prints) with global casual elements like denim and modern silhouettes. Aishwarya Rai Bachchan's appearance in a couture sherwani at Paris Fashion Week further underscores the global recognition and high-fashion adaptation of Indian traditional wear, influencing broader trends.\n\n**Sustainable Fashion:** Sustainability is a core value for Gen Z, reflected in several articles. The emphasis on handlooms (Ryndia silk, Ajrakh) highlights a move towards ethically produced, culturally significant textiles. There's a strong push for supporting artisan livelihoods and understanding the entire value chain of traditional crafts. The rise of eco-friendly accessories, such as woven basket bags made from natural and recycled materials, demonstrates a demand for conscious consumption in everyday items. Furthermore, practical advice on restyling old lehengas for festive occasions promotes circular fashion and mindful wardrobe utilization.\n\n**Key Elements:**\n*   **Colors:** While white, ecru, and natural tones are prominent for their crispness and versatility, vibrant accents (fuchsia, yellow, green, crimson red, orange, pink) are used for embellishments and festive wear. Traditional Ajrakh colors (indigo, madder) are also being reinterpreted.\n*   **Fabrics:** Handlooms are central, including various types of cotton, silk (Eri silk, silk-cotton blends), linen, and traditional block-printed textiles like Ajrakh. Modern materials like denim and Tencel are also integrated, often in fusion pieces. Natural fibers like banana fiber, sabai grass, rattan, seagrass, Moonj, Kaans grass, and water hyacinth are trending for accessories.\n*   **Silhouettes:** Comfort and versatility are key. Trends include relaxed-fit dhoti pants, deconstructed saris, summer maxis, asymmetric pants, crop tops, kaftans, and tailored separates. Power shoulders and fluid drapes are also noted. The ability to layer and mix-and-match is highly valued.\n*   **Accessories:** Woven basket bags made from sustainable materials are a significant trend. Traditional Indian jewellery, like silver pieces and kamarbandhs, are being paired with modern and fusion outfits.\n\n**Overall Aesthetic:** The prevailing aesthetic is one of 'Indian Cool' \u2013 a blend of traditional richness with contemporary ease. It's about celebrating cultural heritage without being confined by it, embracing comfort, and making ethical choices. Gen Z women are looking for unique pieces that tell a story, support local craftsmanship, and can be styled in multiple ways for both casual outings and elevated occasions.",

I've identified several articles discussing handlooms, traditional textiles (Odisha Ikat, Eri silk, Ajrakh), traditional Indian wear (sarees, lehengas, dhoti) with modern interpretations, and sustainable fashion practices. The focus on festive wear during Durga Puja and Navratri from Times of India also highlights the ongoing relevance and potential for fusion in traditional attire. I will continue to look for more specific examples of Gen Z casual wear and explicit mentions of sustainable practices within Indian fashion."
